This project is a React + TypeScript single-page app for SCCC AI-Powered Pricing Advisor. Use TailwindCSS for all styling. The app should have:
- Left panel: AI chat window (textarea for user input, message history with styled bubbles for user and AI)
- Right panel: Suggested services (ECS, OSS, TDSQL) with monthly cost breakdown (subtotal, VAT 15%, total) and action buttons (Accept, Request Alternative, Manual Adjust)
- Integrate with /api/ai and /api/pricing endpoints as described in the user request.
